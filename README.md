# SurfsUp
Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Project Overview
After the initial analysis, we are asked to provide more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, we have been asked to provide  temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources
- Data source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy

#### Overview of the statistical analysis
For this task, we will be providing two specific deliverables. 
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

In Table 1 below, you will find the summary statistics for both June and December.

#### Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Of the data collected, we were able to analyze 1700 recorded data points for the month of June and 1517 recorded data points for the month of December. Using the summary statistics for the tempatures recorded in June and Decemeber, we can see the following:

- Maximum Temperature 
  - The maximum tempature recorded for the month of June was 85 degrees.
  - The maximum tempature recorded for the month of December was 81 degrees.
- Minimum Temperature
  - The minimum tempature recorded for the month of June was 64 degrees.
  - The mimimum tempature recorded for the month of December was 56 degrees.
- Average Temperature
  - The average tempature for the month of June is 74 degrees. 
  - The average tempature for the month of December is 71 degrees. 

The bar charts below will provide a glance into the tempature fluctuation during the months of June and December.

#### Summary

Based on the analysis of the data, we can see that temperatures for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii are farily comprable to each other. The average tempature difference between the two months is only three degrees. There was a difference of four degrees in the maximum temperatures for between the two months and a difference of 8 degrees in the minimum tempatures. 

Another key factor we can look at is the amount of precipitation in each month. This will give us an indication of how much it rains in each month to determine if that could have an impact on the amount of customers. From the tables below we can see the average amount of precipation for the month of June was .136 inches and the average for December was .215 inches.

Based on the summary statistics for analysis of the trends in both tempature and precipitation for Oahu, Hawaii for the months of June and December, we can predict this is a favorable location for the next surf and ice cream shop and that the trends in both tempature and precipitation can support a year-around shop.
